  "body": "# pirateplayer-patch\r\n\r\nIf **PiratePlayer** is giving the error:\r\n```\r\nEtt fel uppstod!\r\n```\r\nthen this patch is for you.\r\n\r\nThe original PiratePlayer has not been updated for a long time so channel definitions are in many cases out of sync with the play sites, leading to errors. Sometimes errors are caused by PiratePlayer's dependency to the external service on pirateplay.se.\r\n\r\nThis patch installs modifications that make your existing PiratePlayer installation come alive again by installing updated channel definitions and replacing the media download backend so it doesn't rely on pirateplay.se.\r\n\r\n## Prerequisites\r\n\r\nExisting PiratePlayer installation on Windows\r\n\r\nPowerShell 2.0+ (preinstalled on Windows 7 and onwards)\r\n\r\n## Installing\r\n\r\nDownload and run the install script:\r\n\r\n[pirateplayer-patch-install.bat](https://github.com/mikewse/pirateplayer-patch/releases/download/1.0/pirateplayer-patch-install.bat)\r\n\r\nAccept any UAC elevation prompt.\r\n\r\nThe installation script will patch some PiratePlayer files and also add some of its own files in `(program files)\\Pirateplayer\\patch`. **Svtplay-dl** will also be downloaded to this directory and will effectively replace PiratePlayer's dependency to the stream handling on `pirateplay.se`.\r\n\r\nRun `update.bat` in the `patch` directory to update to the latest changes as they are published.\r\n\r\n## Usage\r\n\r\nPiratePlayer should be started through `pirateplayer-start.bat` in the `patch` directory to function correctly. The installation script will update PiratePlayer's start menu to reflect this, but you need to update any other shortcuts yourself.\r\n\r\nYou'll notice a minimized command prompt window when starting with the patch. This window handles the new download backend and will pop new windows showing progress for each download.\r\n\r\n## Credits\r\n\r\n[pirateplayer](https://github.com/jackuess/pirateplayer) by **jackuess** - the original application updated by this patch (my updates [in this fork](https://github.com/mikewse/pirateplayer))\r\n\r\n[svtplay-dl](https://github.com/spaam/svtplay-dl) by **spaam** - media download engine used in this patch\r\n",
